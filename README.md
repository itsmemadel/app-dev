<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Maxpein is a spunky provincial girl raised by her grandmother and uncle, after her mother died in Japan when she was 11 years old. Maxpein is suprised when her wealthy father, whom she recently discovered, offers to help pay for her grandmother's hospitalization. Out of gratitude, she agrees to her father's request to live with him and his family in Manila. Maxpein is treated as an unwelcome outsider at Benison International School where she stands up against Deib, the basketball varsity captain. Deib gets their entire batchmates to prank and bully Maxpein, but the more they engage in their game of cat-and-dog one-upmanship, the more Deib realizes that his goal to crush Maxpein's spirit has turned into a love crush for the girl he never thought he would even like. However, the return of the ghosts from their past and their various family problems threaten to ruin Max and Deib's blossoming and fragile romance.</p>
